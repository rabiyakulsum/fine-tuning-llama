# Fine-Tuning LLaMA 3-2-3B on Medical QA

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLaMA 3-2-3B language model for answering medical questions. Using a dataset of medical Q&A pairs, we fine-tune the model to improve its performance on specialized healthcare queries. The process is carried out in a Jupyter Notebook, where questions are entered, fine-tuning is performed, and results are evaluated.

## Project Overview

Language models like LLaMA can be adapted for specialized domains through fine-tuning. In this case, we focus on the medical domain, where accurately answering questions requires nuanced understanding and knowledge.

### Objectives
- Fine-tune LLaMA 3-2-3B on a medical QA dataset.
- Improve model accuracy on specialized medical queries.
- Demonstrate the fine-tuning process in an interactive Jupyter Notebook.

## Contents

- **Data Preparation**: Load and preprocess medical Q&A data.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tune the model on the dataset directly within the Jupyter Notebook.
- **Evaluation**: Test the model on new medical questions to assess its performance.
